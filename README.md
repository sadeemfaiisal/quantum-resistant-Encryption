# Quantum-resistant Encryption
NFTs rely on advanced encryption techniques like ECC and RSA to secure communications and validate digital signatures. These methods ensure data protection and the creation of unique signatures for transactions. However, quantum decryption poses a threat, prompting the use of quantum-resistant encryption like Lattice-based cryptography.

# Lattice-based cryptography
Lattice-based cryptography is a type of encryption
technique that relies on mathematics related to
lattice structures. A lattice can be imagined as a
three-dimensional grid of points in space. The
security of this encryption depends on the difficulty
of solving lattice problems, which involve finding a
point within the lattice that lies in the same cell as a
known point.
